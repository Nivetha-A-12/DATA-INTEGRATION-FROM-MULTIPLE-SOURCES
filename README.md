TASK DESCRIPTION:

For my Intern Task 2, I worked on a data integration project using Microsoft Power BI, where the primary objective was to combine data from multiple sourcesspecifically, Excel and CSV files into a unified, interactive dashboard. This task was centered around showcasing how diverse datasets can be harmonized and used to generate meaningful insights in a single report. I began by importing data from Excel and CSV files. Power BI made it easy to connect to both sources using its built-in connectors. From Excel, I extracted structured sheets or named ranges, while the CSV files were loaded as flat tables that required more transformation. Once the data was loaded, I used Power Query Editor to clean and prepare it. For Excel data, I ensured all columns had the right data types and renamed fields for consistency. For CSV data, I handled issues like missing headers, inconsistent delimiters, and null values. After cleaning both datasets, I integrated them using techniques like merge and append queries. I used Merge Queries to perform join-like operations (like VLOOKUP in Excel) between Excel and CSV data. I used Append Queries to stack similar data from different files into a single unified table. This kind of multi-source integration and reporting task has wide relevance in real-world scenarios, including Sales Reporting ,Inventory Management, Marketing Analytics.
